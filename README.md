We are a group of beginner hackers in grade 11. Our project is designed to create a smart speech-to-text notetaking app that classifies thoughts automatically and compiles them. To create it, we used GitHub, Notion, React Native, and Expo Go. 


Run frontend: ```expo start```<br>
Run backend: ```node filename```, in this case ```node appdf.js```<br>
Both should be running simultaneously for the application to properly work
